# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Functionality
- **Orientation-based Controllers:** Do all features (Alarm, Stopwatch, Timer, Weather) work correctly and reliably as the device orientation changes?
- **Feature Completeness:** Are all core functions within each feature implemented and working as expected? (e.g., setting alarms, starting/stopping/lapping the stopwatch).

### 2. User Experience (UX)
- **Intuitiveness:** Is the interface easy to understand and navigate without instruction?
- **Responsiveness:** Does the layout adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations?
- **Visual Appeal:** Is the design aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the specified style guidelines (colors, fonts, icons)?
- **Feedback & Interaction:** Does the app provide clear feedback for user actions? Are animations and transitions smooth?

### 3. AI Prompting & Development Process
- **Efficiency:** How effectively was AI leveraged to accelerate the development process?
- **Effectiveness:** Was the AI prompting clear, concise, and well-structured to achieve the desired outcomes with minimal revisions?
- **Prompting Techniques:** What level of prompting was used? (e.g., basic requests vs. advanced techniques like chain-of-thought, providing examples, or defining complex logic).

### 4. Technical Implementation
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, readable, well-organized, and easy to maintain?
- **Efficiency:** Is the code performant? Are there any unnecessary re-renders or performance bottlenecks?
- **Best Practices:** Does the code follow established Next.js, React, and TypeScript best practices?
- **Documentation:** Are components and complex logic adequately commented where necessary?

### 5. Wow! Factor
- **Creative AI Integration:** Does the project incorporate generative AI in a unique or particularly impressive way that enhances the user experience beyond the basic requirements?
- **Polished Micro-interactions:** Are there subtle, high-quality animations and transitions that make the app feel alive and delightful to use?
- **Advanced Customization:** Does the app offer unexpected user customization, such as theme selection, different alarm sounds, or personalized weather alerts?
- **Exceptional Accessibility (a11y):** Does the project go above and beyond standard accessibility practices, ensuring a flawless experience for users with disabilities?
- **Innovative Features:** Did the project include any clever or novel features not specified in the initial requirements that add significant value?
